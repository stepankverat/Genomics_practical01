Think about your experimental design. Which experimental groups would you like to compare? Based on what we learnt about contrasts in DESeq2, would you apply the approach outlined in Chapter I (compare only two groups) or Chapter II (compare two or more groups using a special function)?

### Chapter I: Compare only two groups

Use this approach when you're comparing exactly **two groups**, such as:
- Control vs Treatment
- Wildtype vs Mutant
- Genotype A vs Genotype B

Here, you use the formula `design = ~grouping`, which tells DESeq2 to model gene expression based on the **levels in the 'grouping' column** of your metadata. So, 'grouping' refers to the column in your metadata file that defines experimental groups.
# ~grouping includes an intercept (baseline group)

By setting the levels manually (e.g., `c("control", "treatment")`), you're defining which is the **baseline (control)** and which is the **comparison (treatment)** group.

# Create a DESeq2 dataset and run the analysis

To perform differential expression analysis, DESeq2 needs both the **raw gene counts** and the **sample information (metadata)** in a specific format — this is called a **DESeqDataSet**.

The DESeq2 dataset combines:
- The **counts matrix** (genes x samples) — tells DESeq2 how many reads mapped to each gene.
- The **metadata** (samples x variables) — tells DESeq2 which samples belong to which experimental groups (e.g., treatment vs control).
- A **design formula** — defines which variable(s) DESeq2 should use to compare groups.

```{r}
# Create a DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~grouping)  # Make sure to replace 'grouping' with the column you're using for comparison in your metadata

# Make sure grouping is a factor
dds$grouping <- factor(dds$grouping, levels=c("level 1", "level 2"))

# (OPTIONAL) Remove genes with very low counts across all samples
# Keep genes where the total count across all samples is at least 10
dds <- dds[rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10, ]

# Run the differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

# View and filter results

```{r}
# Perform your desired contrast   
results_table <- results(dds, contrast = c("grouping", "level 1", "level 2"))

# In a DESeq2 model, R compares two groups:
# - One group is used as the "baseline" (this is the intercept)
# - The difference between the other group and the baseline is the "coefficient"
# This tells us how much more or less a gene is expressed in one group compared to the other.

# Remove genes with missing values
results_table <- na.omit(results_table)

# Filter for significant genes (adjusted p-value < 0.05)
significant_genes <- results_table[results_table$padj < 0.05, ]

# Check how many genes are significant
nrow(significant_genes)
```

How many genes passed the significance threshold?

# Identify Up- and Down-regulated genes

```{r}
# Up-regulated in inter (log2 Fold Change > 1)
up_genes <- significant_genes[significant_genes$log2FoldChange > 1, ]

# Down-regulated in inter (log2 Fold Change < -1)
down_genes <- significant_genes[significant_genes$log2FoldChange < -1, ]
```

Out of all the significantly differentially expressed genes, how many were upregulated and how many were downregulated?

# Save the results

```{r}
write.csv(as.data.frame(up_genes), "your_output_up.csv")
write.csv(as.data.frame(down_genes), "your_output_down.csv")
```

### Chapter II: Compare two or more groups using contraster()

Use this approach when:
- You want to compare **a group vs. the average** of multiple other groups
- You want to customize contrasts beyond simple pairwise comparisons
- Your experimental design involves more than two groups

Here, the formula is `design = ~0 + grouping`, which removes the default intercept and lets you manually build contrasts using the `contraster()` function.

The `grouping` column in your metadata should still define the biological groups (e.g., genotypes, treatments), but now you have more flexibility.

For example:

group1 = list(c("grouping", "treatment A", "treatment B"))
group2 = list(c("grouping", "control"))

This compares the average of treatment A and treatment B to control.

# Create a DESeq2 dataset and run the analysis

```{r}
# Create a DESeq2 object
# design = ~grouping means we're comparing based on the "grouping" column
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~0+grouping)
# ~0 + grouping removes intercept and estimates each group separately

# Make sure grouping is a factor
dds$grouping <- factor(dds$grouping, levels=c("level 1", "level 2", "level 3"...))

# (OPTIONAL) Remove genes with very low counts across all samples
# Keep genes where the total count across all samples is at least 10
dds <- dds[rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10, ]

# Run the differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

# Define the contraster function

```{r}
contraster <- function(dds,    # should contain colData and design
                       group1, # list of character vectors each with 2 or more items 
                       group2, # list of character vectors each with 2 or more items
                       weighted = F
){
  
  
  mod_mat <- model.matrix(design(dds), colData(dds))
  
  grp1_rows <- list()
  grp2_rows <- list()
  
  
  for(i in 1:length(group1)){
    
    grp1_rows[[i]] <- colData(dds)[[group1[[i]][1]]] %in% group1[[i]][2:length(group1[[i]])]
    
  }
  
  
  for(i in 1:length(group2)){
    
    grp2_rows[[i]] <- colData(dds)[[group2[[i]][1]]] %in% group2[[i]][2:length(group2[[i]])]
    
  }
  
  grp1_rows <- Reduce(function(x, y) x & y, grp1_rows)
  grp2_rows <- Reduce(function(x, y) x & y, grp2_rows)
  
  mod_mat1 <- mod_mat[grp1_rows, ,drop=F]
  mod_mat2 <- mod_mat[grp2_rows, ,drop=F]
  
  if(!weighted){
    
    mod_mat1 <- mod_mat1[!duplicated(mod_mat1),,drop=F]
    mod_mat2 <- mod_mat2[!duplicated(mod_mat2),,drop=F]
    
  }
  
  return(colMeans(mod_mat1)-colMeans(mod_mat2))
  
  
}
```

# View and filter results

```{r}
# Perform your desired contrast   
results_table1 <- results(dds, 
                contrast = contraster(dds, 
                                      group1 = list(c("grouping", "level 1")),
                                      group2 = list(c("grouping", "level 3", "level 4"))))

# Check the intercept and coefficients*
contraster(dds, 
           group1 = list(c("grouping", "level 1")), 
           group2 = list(c("grouping", "level 3", "level 4")))

# Remove genes with missing values
results_table1 <- na.omit(results_table1)

# Filter for significant genes (adjusted p-value < 0.05)
significant_genes1 <- results_table1[results_table1$padj < 0.05, ]

# Check how many genes are significant
nrow(significant_genes1)
```

\*Simple Analogy for Intercepts and Coefficients:

Imagine you're comparing how tall people are in two different classrooms: Class A and Class B.

-   The intercept is like the average height of the first group you're using as a baseline --- for example, Class A.

-   The coefficient is how much taller or shorter people in Class B are compared to Class A.

Here, we're doing the same thing --- just not with height, but with gene expression.

# Identify Up- and Down-regulated genes

```{r}
# Up-regulated in inter (log2 Fold Change > 1)
up_genes1 <- significant_genes1[significant_genes1$log2FoldChange > 1, ]

# Down-regulated in inter (log2 Fold Change < -1)
down_genes1 <- significant_genes1[significant_genes1$log2FoldChange < -1, ]
```

# Save the results

```{r}
# Save results to CSV
write.csv(as.data.frame(up_genes1), "your_output_up.csv")
write.csv(as.data.frame(down_genes1), "your_output_down.csv")
```
