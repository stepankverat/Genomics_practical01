Why are we using PCA in RNA-seq analysis? What can it tell us about the samples? What kind of variation is PCA capturing --- technical or biological?

Which input data would you use for PCA and Why? Should you use all genes for PCA? Why or why not? These questions will help you use to understand script below.

# Get started

```{r}
# Check your current directory
getwd()

# Set your working directory
setwd("J:/Dropbox/Prague/Teaching/Course genomics of speciation/2024-2025/RNA-Seq practical/PCA visualization")
```

# Import data

```{r}
# Load expression data and sample metadata (contains sample information)
expr_matrix <- read.csv("your_read_counts.csv", row.names = 1)
metadata <- read.csv("your_sample_metadata.csv", row.names = 1)

# Check the structure of the imported files
head(expr_matrix)
head(metadata)

# Check that the samples in both files match
all(colnames(expr_matrix) == rownames(metadata))  # should return TRUE
```

What kind of information about the experimental design can you find in the metadata file?

# Prepare files before running PCA

```{r}
# Add 1 to ensure that the smallest value is log2(1) = 0
log_expr <- log2(expr_matrix + 1)

# Calculate the variance in expression of each gene across all samples
var_genes <- apply(log_expr, 1, var)

# Filter to keep only genes with non-zero variance
log_expr_filtered <- log_expr[var_genes > 0, ]
```

Why did we apply a log transformation to expression values before running PCA? Why did we remove genes with zero variance across all samples?

# Running PCA

To perform PCA in R, use the `prcomp()` function with a matrix where rows are samples and columns are variables (e.g., genes).

```{r}
# Transpose the matrix so rows = samples, columns = genes
# Center and scale genes so each contributes equally to PCA
pca <- prcomp(t(log_expr_filtered), scale. = TRUE)

# View a summary of the PCA results
summary(pca)
```

`scale. = TRUE` standardizes each gene (z-score), ensuring that PCA isn't dominated by highly expressed genes.

# Visualizing PCA

```{r}
# Basic PCA scatter plot using base R
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2],
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2",
     main = "PCA Plot",
     pch = 19, col = "blue")
```

```{r}
# Calculate % variance explained
percent_var <- round(summary(pca)$importance[2, 1:2] * 100, 1)

# Extract PC scores for samples
pca_scores <- pca$x[, 1:2]

# Get grouping from metadata (make sure order matches rownames of pca$x)
grouping <- as.factor(metadata[rownames(pca_scores), "grouping"])  # 'grouping' column in the metadata represents the experimental condition you want to use to check if samples cluster together or differ in the PCA

# Assign color values based on grouping factor levels
colors <- as.factor(grouping)

# Plot PCA
plot(pca_scores,
     col = colors,
     pch = 19,
     xlab = paste0("PC1 (", percent_var[1], "%)"),
     ylab = paste0("PC2 (", percent_var[2], "%)"),
     main = "PCA Plot Colored by Grouping")

# Add legend
legend("topright", 
       legend = levels(grouping), 
       col = 1:length(levels(grouping)), 
       pch = 19)
```

Do your PCA results support your experimental design or hypothesis? Why or why not?
