# EBN Effect on Hybrid Endosperm Gene Expression

## Project Summary
This project investigates how differences in Endosperm Balance Number (EBN) between parent species affect gene expression in hybrid seed endosperm.

## Hypothesis
- When species with different EBN values hybridize, the standard maternal:paternal genome ratio (2:1) becomes skewed
- Maternally expressed genes should show different expression levels in reciprocal crosses (Species A × Species B vs Species B × Species A)
- Expression patterns should reflect the EBN imbalance between parents
